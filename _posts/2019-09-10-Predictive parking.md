# Demo : Parky - Predictive parking 

Datategy launched their first smart city solution, OctoCity, in 2016. This platform is the result of an in-depth understanding of urban dynamics, developed using deep learning techniques. Building on this success, Datategy focused on a new challenge: on-street parking. In 2019, they published a scientific paper outlining a Generic Predictive Model for On-Street Parking Availability.

The insights from this research led to the creation of Parky, a mobile app designed to forecast on-street parking availability worldwide. Parky uses an innovative method that goes beyond traditional geo-coordinates to define parking spots. Instead, it leverages data from nearby amenities, enabling the app to utilize various datasets and eliminate the need for strict geo-location data. This flexible approach allows parking dynamics from one city to be applied to another, enhancing the modelâ€™s adaptability and efficiency.
